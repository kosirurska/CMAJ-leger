**Abstract**:

**Background**: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in many disruptions, some of which may have particularly impacted young people with chronic health conditions. In this study, we report on the psychological impacts of the pandemic on young adults with and without chronic health conditions. 

**Methods**: Analyses used seven independent cross-sectional rounds of a Canadian representative survey collected between June, 2020, and September, 2021. Anxiety, depression and loneliness levels were compared between young adults with and without chronic health conditions at each survey round using chisquare. Logistic regressions assessed the associations between anxiety, depression and loneliness and demographic factors within each group.  Post Hoc multivariate logistic regressions were run to assess if young adults with chronic conditions experience higher odds of reporting psychological distress. 

**Results**: Participants were young adults (N = 7,186; aged 18-39; 60% female).  Among those, 25% reported having one or more chronic health conditions. Being female, younger, and having a mental health diagnosis was associated with higher levels of reported distress across the pandemic, regardless of health status. Multivariate analyses showed that compared to healthy peers, young adults with chronic conditions reported significantly higher anxiety (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 – 1.32, p = 0.04), and loneliness (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.01 – 1.33, p = 0.041), but not depression.

**Interpretation**: Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young adults with and without chronic health conditions can help us improve existing resources and adapt public health policies to prevent the lingering effects from psychological distress on long-term health.

This is a sub-folder containing some analytical scripts and work done in preparation for the abstract submitted to the Canadian Psychological Association Meeting in 2022. The work was initiated and led by KS, I only assissted in the analyses. The work considers general Canadian population with non-communicable diseases hence relevant to this repository.
