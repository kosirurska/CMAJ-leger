**Abstract**:

**Background**: The spread of COVID-19 resulted in many changes in medical care, which may have particularly impacted young people with chronic health conditions. In this study we report on psychological impact of COVID-19 and compare young adults with and without physical chronic health conditions across time. 

**Methods**: The analyses are based on 6 independent cross-sectional rounds of a Canadian representative survey collected between June 2020 and September 2021 (www.icarestudy.com). General linear models were used to compare levels of psychological distress between individuals with physical chronic health conditions and healthy peers across the pandemic. Models adjusted for sex, age, and mental health diagnosis.

**Results**: Participants were young adults (YAs; N = 6,170; aged 18 – 39, 60% female).  Among those 1,544 (25%) reported having physical chronic health conditions. The level of distress over the course of the pandemic varied significantly among YAs without chronic conditions, F(5, 4380) = 12.99, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.01, but not among YAs with said conditions. The level of distress experienced among YAs with chronic conditions was significantly higher at 3 survey rounds that coincide with a more stable epidemiological state. Being female, younger, and having a mental health diagnosis was associated with higher levels of reported distress across the pandemic regardless of the health status.

**Interpretation**: Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on young adults with and without chronic health conditions will help us improve the existing resources and adapt public health policies to prevent the lingering effects of psychological distress on long-term health outcomes.

This is a sub-folder containing some analytical scripts and work done in preparation for the abstract submitted to the Canadian Psychological Association Meeting in 2022. The work was initiated and led by KS, I only assissted in the analyses. The work considers general Canadian population with non-communicable diseases hence relevant to this repository.
