###  
**March 2021**

Note, this project began as soon as I joined the new lab. I started the project log recently with the updates and changes. This is to assure for transparency of the work. As a result, some of the reporting of the process is retrospective.

####  Prospective reporting starts

**Wednesday, November 17, 2021**
Met KJD, TBP in order to discuss the findings (visual data exploration).
